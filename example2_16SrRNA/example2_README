--------
The example in this directory is designed to highlight a few of the
features of MetaPASSAGE. Many options are available that are not
shown in these examples. See the README and the pipeline source code
for more information.

---------
example2_16SrRNA: 
 
 This is an example of using the simulation pipeline MetaPASSAGE on
 16S rRNA sequences (that have been converted first to DNA bases). It
 demonstrates how populations with skewed taxonomic distributions may
 be simulated. It also gives an illustration of how the reference
 database can be used in composing the simulated population, in this
 case to make sure that no exact copy of a sequence from the reference
 database appears in the population simulated. Finally, it shows how
 the pipeline can be run in batch.

 See example2_runsims.pl and example2_refdb_create.pl for more
 information.

---------
Directory: /examples/example2_16SrRNA
Contains the following files:


16SrRNA.fna : a set of 16S rRNA sequences from NCBI that have been
   converted to DNA. (To make this conversion, you can use the script
   RNA2DNA.pl in the util_scripts directory.)


example2_refdb_create.pl : Perl script example for creating a
   reference database from a subset of the sequences above.

example2_refdb_create.out : The output redirected from stdout from
   runn1ng example2_refdb_create.pl, which illustrates the process of
   refDB creation in this instance.

*** 
example2_runsims.pl : The main Perl script for this example. It
   creates a few simulations from the 16S sequences and demonstrates
   some of the capabilities of the pipeline. See the Perl script for
   more details.
***

example2_runsims.out : The output redirected from stdout from running
   example2_runsims.pl, which illustrates the steps used in this
   instance of the pipeline.

------------
Running the example2_refdb_create.pl script creates the following
   file, an example of which is in the example2_sample_output
   directory:


RefDB_16SrRNA_200.fna : A fasta file containing a simulated "reference
   database" of 200 16S sequences, chosen uniformly at random from the
   example2_refdb_create.pl.

------------
Running the example2_runsims.pl script creates, among other output
   files, the following alignment files, examples of which are in the
   example2_sample_output directory: (Note that the alignment files
   are each placed in the appropriate simulation subdirectory but
   examples have been copied from the subdirectories to
   example2_sample_output; also the top-level directories have been
   tar'd and zipped to compress the size.)


sim<X>_16S_ratio1p5-src-pd-reads-rp-thr-or-<Y>-RefDB.sto (where <X>,
   which labels the simulation trial, is either 1 or 2, and <Y> is a
   number between 900 and 1000, giving the final number of reads that
   were recognized as 16S and passed a minimal length threshold) :
   These are stockholm alignments of the correctly oriented reads and
   the reference database sequences in RefDB_16SrRNA_200.fna.  These
   reads were generated by simulating a population with a very skewed
   distribution (a few sequences had much larger simulated relative
   abundance). The long file name captures the main steps the pipeline
   took to create the file.

sim<X>_16S_ratio1-src-pd-reads-rp-thr-or-<Y>-RefDB.sto : Analogous
  files to those above except that these reads were generated by
  simulating a population with uniform relative abundances.

---------
Output directories:


sims_16S_ratio1p5.tgz : An actual simulation produces a bunch of files
   which may or may not interest the user. This tar'd and zip'd file
   contains all of the files produced for every simulation above
   involving the skewed distribution of relative abundances. A
   description of what is contained in each of these files can be
   found in the MetaPASSAGE README.

sims_16S_ratio1.tgz : The analogous file to that above, for the
   simulations involving the uniform distribution of relative
   abundances.
