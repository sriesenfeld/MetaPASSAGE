--------
The example in this directory is designed to highlight a few of the
features of MetaPASSAGE. Many options are available that are not
shown in these examples. See the README and the pipeline source code
for more information.

---------
example1_AMPHORA_rpoB: 
 
 This is an example of using the simulation pipeline MetaPASSAGE with
 AMPHORA's repository of rpoB protein sequences. It demonstrates the
 tight integration of the simulation pipeline with AMPHORA. This
 analysis uses tools built into AMPHORA to find and align sequences to
 the hmm model it stores. This example also suggests how the effect of
 limited prior knowledge about the universe of sequences for a gene
 family may be studied by using different reference
 databases. Moreover, it shows how a novel sequencing error model can
 be incorporated easily in the simulation of reads by MetaSim. It
 incorporates a filtering of the reads after they are generated in
 order to retain only one per distinct full-length sequence. Finally,
 it gives an idea of how the pipeline may be run in batch.

 See example1_runsims.pl and example1_refdb_create.pl for more
 information.

---------
Directory: /examples/example1_AMPHORA_rpoB
Contains the following files:


example1_refdb_create.pl : Perl script example for creating a
   reference database with an AMPHORA gene family

example1_refdb_create.out : The output redirected from stdout from
   runn1ng example1_refdb_create.pl, which illustrates the process of
   refDB creation in this instance.

***
example1_runsims.pl : The main Perl script for this example. It
   creates a few simulations from the AMPHORA rpoB protein family and
   demonstrates some of the capabilities of the pipeline. See the Perl
   script for more details.
***

example1_runsims.out : The output redirected from stdout from running
   example1_runsims.pl, which illustrates the steps used in this
   instance of the pipeline.

---------
Running the example1_refdb_create.pl script creates the following
  files, examples of which are in the example1_sample_output
  directory:


RefDB_rpoB_200.pep, RefDB_rpoB_200.fna : The first file is a fasta
   file containing a simulated "reference database" of 200 rpoB
   sequences, and the second file contains the corresponding DNA
   sequences; both are created by example1_refdb_create.pl. A quarter
   of these sequences were chosen to maximize phylogenetic diversity
   according to the AMPHORA Genome tree. The result were selected
   uniformly at random from the rest of the rpoB sequences.  

RefDB_rpoB_20.pep, RefDB_rpoB_20.fna : Analogous to the above
   reference database, but with 20 instead of 200 sequences.

---------
Running the example1_runsims.pl script creates, among other output
   files, the following alignment files, examples of which are in the
   example1_sample_output directory: (Note that the alignment files
   are each placed in the appropriate simulation subdirectory but
   examples have been copied from the subdirectories to
   example1_sample_output; also the top-level directories have been
   tar'd and zipped to compress the size.)


sim<X>_rpoB_RefDB_200-src-pd-reads-rp-thr-rpoB-sr-RefDB.aln (where
   <X>, which labels the simulation trial, is either 1 or 2) : These
   are the fasta alignments from both trials of the translated reads
   and the reference database sequences in RefDB_rpoB_200.pep. The
   reads in each trial are filtered so that at most one read is in the
   alignment for each corresponding full-length sequence. The long
   file name captures the main steps the pipeline took to create the
   file.

sim<X>_rpoB_RefDB_20_<X>-src-pd-reads-rp-thr-rpoB-sr-RefDB.aln : The
  analogous files to those above using the reference database
  RefDB_rpoB_20.pep.

sim<X>_rpoB_RefDB_200-src-final<Y>-RefDB.aln (where <X>, which labels
   the simulation trial, is either 1 or 2, and <Y> is some number
   close to 200 giving the number of distinct full-length sequences in
   the corresponding file) : Sequences in this file are either in the
   reference database or they are represented in the set of reads that
   corresponds to the same simulation trial. This is a fasta alignment
   of full-length gene sequences.

sim<X>_rpoB_RefDB_20_<X>-src-final<Y>-RefDB.aln : The analogous files
   to those above, using the reference database RefDB_rpoB_20.pep

---------
Output directories:


sims_rpoB_RefDB_200.tgz : An actual simulation produces lots of files
   which may or may not interest the user. This tar'd and zip'd file
   contains contains all files produced for every simulation involving
   the reference database RefDB_rpoB_200. A description of what is
   contained in each of these files can be found in the MetaPASSAGE
   README.

sims_rpoB_RefDB_20.tgz : The analogous file to that above, using the
   reference database RefDB_rpoB_20.pep.
