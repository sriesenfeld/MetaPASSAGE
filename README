MetaPASSAGE README
Last updated: Nov 2010

This README contains information about MetaPASSAGE (a Metagenomic
Pipeline for Automated Simulations and Analysis of Gene Families). It
is still currently under construction. Much more information, along
with example scripts showing how to use the pipeline will be included
soon.

The script MetaPASSAGE.pl assumes that the Perl can find the modules
in the simPipeModules directory. The easiest way to ensure this is to add
a line like

export PERL5LIB=$PERL5LIB:/home/sriesenfeld/projects/MetaPASSAGE/simPipeModules

to your .bashrc file.

------

The following must be installed for full functionality of the
pipeline. Modular functionality will be discussed below.

A recent version of Perl (5.10 would be ideal)
NCBI-BLAST (blastx, blastp, formatdb)
HMMER (hmmalign) (You need HMMER 2 for use with AMPHORA)
EMBOSS (transeq)
MetaSim
AMPHORA
BioPerl (for use with AMPHORA only)

Variables that you may want to customize are in SimPipeVars.pm.

-----

To get help with the options, run this at the command line:

perl MetaPASSAGE.pl -h
